Today we met and figured out what part #s we were planning on using.

9/25/2025
Today we finsihed designing the 1st draft of our schematic, we made sure to research proper design decisions when using our selected components
we were able to complete the entire thing.

9/27/2025
routed PCB, will have to verify it and make sure everything is proper later

10/4/2025
MEt with team and worked on PCB had issue with pad width

10/8/2025
met with team, worked on design document

10/11/2025
Realzied we had an issue with a minimum threshold voltage to use the Powermux so had a to add aboost converter to step up voltage form 3.7v to 5v


10/15/2025
Met with team to overview software requriements downloaded crow to start writing client code

10/18/2025
got First round PCB and ordered appropriate components so that our board can be functional

10/19/2025
Tested board and saw that buck converter was out putting 4.2v intead of 3.3v, looked into issue and met with jack blevins to get some mentorship on the issue

10/21/2025
worked on the  issuea and redesinged board and schematic to use a better buck and boost converter so that our circuit was simpler as more components are now in the IC, and then also amde sure to to find a IC that was a big easy to solder footprint

10/23/2025
pordered new components and met with team to give progress report also finalzed new PCB and submitted order for round 3

11/1/2025
Looked into debugging new baord a little more and realized that a major issue would stem from the high current draw caused by the WIFI usage of the ESP32 will look more into this

11/3/2025
to mitigate these issue will need to find a battery that is 3.7v and can handle 400-500ma at peak current draw, found one online and ordered it

11/13/2025
waiting fro new PCB but parts ahve arrived hoping to get everythign soldered together for a final demo in 1 week.
