We met today with Lukas and have reorinted ourselves to finish our goals.

Our Goals:

* Rough PCB design by end of weekend
* Schedule with Jack to go over desgin decisions
* Create a final part list
* Split up PCB design

We worked on creating a part list on google docs:[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e973Mm_vhnLTH5vz_4C17udLJVd2HXl1_8vYD8PnHUg/edit?usp=sharing](https://)

I worked on finding the correct Raspberry Pi parts including our touch screen. We should be good and done with our design decisions.

We met today and worked on our schematic. I also created the drawing and emailed it to the machine shop. Upon doing so we have put them in the loop. We are going to try and finish our pcb today. I set up a meeting with Jack on Tuesday.
I worked on developing the PCB and now it just needs to be routed. I found all the footprints for our parts

10/3/25:

This week we discussed multiple times the breadboard design. We have about finished our pcb design. Today I worked on finishing the routing of the pcb after we made changes, we added a charging circuit. We did this after talking to Jack Blevins, who suggested we just directly power our MCU from the battery. This way you won't have to switch out the coincell battery, it will recharge off the wall.
