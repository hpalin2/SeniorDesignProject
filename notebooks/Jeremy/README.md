**2025-09-2024 - Part Sourcing and PCB Planning**

---

Today we focused on sourcing all of our parts and delegating out work for the PCB design. I helped research our AAFS component and determine the proper resistance needed for our voltage divider. In addition, I also contacted the facility manager at Carle to see if I could get connected with Epic.

**Our Goals:**
Rough PCB design by end of weekend
Schedule with Jack to go over desgin decisions
Create a final part list
Split up PCB design

We worked on creating a part list on google docs:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e973Mm_vhnLTH5vz_4C17udLJVd2HXl1_8vYD8PnHUg/edit?usp=sharing
